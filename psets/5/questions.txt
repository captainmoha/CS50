0.  An artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.

1.  getrusuage is function that returns resource usage for a given process, its children, or its thread.
	it returns 0 on success and -1 on error

2.  The rusage struct has 16 members.

3.  The variables before and after are of type rusage. rusage is a structure that consists of 16 memebers.
	These memebers take a up a considerable amount of space so passin them by value is relatively time-consuming.
	When we pass by reference, we pass the actual strcture, so we avoid the work needed to copy the structure when we pass by value. This helps performance.


4.  In speller.c the for loop that reads in words from the text file works as follows:
	
	- Firstly, some variables are initialized to 0 in order to use them as counters for different things.
		- index: used to access a char in the char array which represents the word.
		- words: keeps the number of words currently loaded from the file.
		- misspellings: keeps the number of misspelled words in the file.

	- Then, we go through the file letter by letter using the fgetc() function.
		- while each time making sure that we only consider a word valid, if it is comprised of only alphabetical chars or apostrophes. And it's not longer than LENGTH which is define in dictionary.h. If a word isn't valid we just read the rest of its charachters (without doing anything with them) to move the file cursor to the next word.

	- Finally, once we made sure that a word is valid.
		- we increment the words counter.
		- we call the check() function on the word to see it was misspelled, and we measure the time that the check() function took to run. We do this using getrusage().
		- if the word is misspelled we update the misspelled counter.
		- we the prepare to read a new word by reseting the index to 0 in order to read the new word into the string correctly.


5.  We read one char at a time in order to be able to validate that the word is valid, ie : it is comprised of only
	alphabetical chars or apostrophes. And more importantly to make sure that the word fits into our char array.
	if we read a word that doesn't fit we will be accessing memory that we shouldn't and hence we may get a segmentation fault.

6.  The parameters for check() and load() are define as constants because this makes sure that the parameters are not
	changed inside the function. It is also a good practice to do this to point out that this argument is input that should
	not be changed.
